# Earth's energy imbalance

*“Ocean motions result from the overall forcing of the climate system but are filtered through various processes on different scales before arriving at the motions of interest for a particular application.”* -- [BFK18]

Air-sea interactions refer to the dynamic processes and exchanges that occur between the atmosphere and the ocean. These interactions play a critical role in regulating Earth's climate, weather patterns, and the global energy balance. 

Key processes involved in air-sea interactions include:

- **Heat Exchange**: The transfer of heat between the ocean and the atmosphere, influencing sea surface temperatures and atmospheric circulation.
- **Momentum Transfer**: The exchange of momentum through wind stress, which drives ocean currents and waves.
- **Gas Exchange**: The transfer of gases like carbon dioxide and oxygen, which are essential for marine ecosystems and climate regulation.
- **Moisture Exchange**: The evaporation and precipitation processes that contribute to the hydrological cycle.

Understanding air-sea interactions is essential for studying climate change, predicting extreme weather events, and managing marine resources effectively.
