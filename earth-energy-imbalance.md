# Global energy distribution and air-sea interactions

*“Ocean motions result from the overall forcing of the climate system but are filtered through various processes on different scales before arriving at the motions of interest for a particular application.”* -- [BFK18]

I quite like this quote because when we talk about scales of interest it really depends on your application. Each has their relative importance and necessity to understand and be curious about.

## Global energy budget

The Earth's atmospehre recieves it heat through solar radiation, which acts primarily in the wavelength range of 0.25-4 micrometres (µm). Meanwhile, outgoing longwave radiation falls within the infrared portion of the spectrum and has typical wavelengths of 4 to 30 µm.

Globally, over the year, the Earth system - land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere - absorbs an average of about 239 watts of solar power per square meter (1 watt = 1 J/s).

Joule is a unit of energy that measures the energy required to create heat.

**What are some consequences of this energy uptake on Earth?**
