# Introduction to air-sea interactions
---

Welcome! This site hosts my notes on air-sea interactions that I have compiled for the Masters in Marine Science course *"Observing the ocean from micro to macro scale"* at the University of Gothenburg. I am hosted at the University as a researcher and am grateful to be a lecturer on this course. The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/marcelduplessis/air-sea-interactions-notes) and so if you find mistakes or would like specific content added, please create an issue. 

I would like to acknowledge that my learning of air-sea interactions is thanks to the time and efforts of my teachers and collaborators, to whom I am grateful for. These include but not limited to Mathieu Rouault, Brian Ward, Sebastiaan Swart, Sarh Nicholson, Meghan Cronin, and Sabrina Speich. In some ways, the content of this site is thanks to them.

*A note on fluxes*: At present, this site focuses on the air-sea exchange of heat. There are of course many other fluxes important for understanding climate, not least CO$_{2}$. Maybe one day I will add some info on that.
