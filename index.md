<h1>Introduction to air-sea interactions</h1>

*Marcel du Plessis*


*2025-05-24*


## Welcome

These notes on air-sea interactions were created for the Masters in Marine Science OC4920 course *"Observing the ocean from micro to macro scale"* at the University of Gothenburg. The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/marcelduplessis/air-sea-interactions-notes) and have been created relatively recently, so if you find a lack of clarity or other errors, please create an GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/marcelduplessis/air-sea-interactions-notes/issues). 

I'd acknowledge that my learning of air-sea interactions is thanks to the time and efforts of many of my teachers and colleagues. In many ways, the content of this site is thanks to them.

I would also like to add that while air-sea interactions represent the exchange of a wide range of properties across the air-sea interface, the notes presented here focus almost exclusively on air-sea **heat exchange**. 


## Additional Resources

These notes are created to be stand-alone for the air-sea interactions module of the OC4920 course. You will find it beneficial to do your own reading around the subject to extend your knowledge beyond what is presented here. There are a number of reading material that you will find helpful, some of which I have listed in the references.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Earth's energy distribution 
- Differentiate the difference between direct and indirect measurements of air-sea fluxes
- Define the oceanic and meteorological variables that are required to study air-sea interactions
- Discuss the main sources of uncertainties in air-sea flux estimates
- Explain the pro's and con's of the different instrumentation used to observe air-sea fluxes
- Define basics on modeling air-sea fluxes
- Have a global understanding of international efforts to understand air-sea interactions
