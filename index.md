# Lecture notes on air-sea interactions

These lecture notes were designed for the Masters in Marine Science course "Observing the ocean from micro to macro scale" at the University of Gothenburg. However, I have also generated these to be useful in general understanding of air-sea interactions. These notes are hosted on a github repository here. If you find any mistakes, please create an issue there.
