# Notes on air-sea interactions

Air-sea interactions refer to the dynamic processes and exchanges that occur between the atmosphere and the ocean. These interactions play a critical role in regulating Earthâ€™s climate, weather patterns, and the global energy balance.

Key processes involved in air-sea interactions include:

    Heat Exchange: The transfer of heat between the ocean and the atmosphere, influencing sea surface temperatures and atmospheric circulation.
    Momentum Transfer: The exchange of momentum through wind stress, which drives ocean currents and waves.
    Gas Exchange: The transfer of gases like carbon dioxide and oxygen, which are essential for marine ecosystems and climate regulation.
    Moisture Exchange: The evaporation and precipitation processes that contribute to the hydrological cycle.

Understanding air-sea interactions is essential for studying climate change, predicting extreme weather events, and managing marine resources effectively.

### Note

I have developed these notes on air-sea interactions for the Masters in Marine Science course **"Observing the ocean from micro to macro scale"** at the University of Gothenburg, but they also serve for a general understanding of air-sea interactions. These notes are hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/marcelduplessis/air-sea-interactions-notes). If you find mistakes or would like content added, please create an issue.
