# Introduction to air-sea interactions
---

Welcome! This site hosts notes on air-sea interactions that I have compiled for the Masters in Marine Science course **"Observing the ocean from micro to macro scale"** at the University of Gothenburg, and also for a general understanding of air-sea interactions. The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/marcelduplessis/air-sea-interactions-notes). If you find mistakes or would like content added, please create an issue. 

In this site, when I refer to fluxes, I am primarily talking about heat flux. There are of course many other fluxes that are important for understanding climate, not least CO$_2$. Maybe one day I will add some info on that.
