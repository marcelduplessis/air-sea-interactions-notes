title: Introduction to Air-Sea Interactions
---

*Marcel du Plessis*


*2025-04-23*


## Welcome


The notes on air-sea interactions are for the Masters in Marine Science course *"Observing the ocean from micro to macro scale"* at the University of Gothenburg. The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/marcelduplessis/air-sea-interactions-notes). These notes have been created relatively recently and so if you find a lack of clarity or other errors, please create an GitHub issue. 

I would like to acknowledge that my learning of air-sea interactions is thanks to the time and efforts of my teachers and collaborators, to whom I am grateful for. These include but not limited to Mathieu Rouault, Brian Ward, Sebastiaan Swart, Sarh Nicholson, Meghan Cronin, and Sabrina Speich. In some ways, the content of this site is thanks to them.

*A note on fluxes:*: these notes focus almost exclusively on **heat exchange**: which can be defined as the transfer of heat between the ocean and the atmosphere, influencing sea surface temperatures and atmospheric circulation. 


## Additional Resources


These notes are created to be stand-alone for the air-sea interactions module of the OC4920 course. They are based on various material that I have sourced via readings or online. You will find it beneficial to do your own reading around the subject to extend your knowledge beyond what is presented here. There are a number of reading material listed below that you will find helpful.
