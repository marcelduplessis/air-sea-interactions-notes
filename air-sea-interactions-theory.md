<h1> Basics of Air-Sea Interactions Theory </h1>

Air-sea interaction refers to the exchange of energy, momentum, and mass between the atmosphere and the ocean.

These interactions play a central role in weather, climate regulation, and ocean circulation.

<h2> Key Components Involved </h2>

**Atmosphere:** The lower part (troposphere) is most relevant for interactions.
**Ocean Surface Layer:** The uppermost layer (~10â€“100 m), also known as the mixed layer, is directly influenced by atmospheric forcing.

<h2> Energy Exchange Processes </h2>

<h3> Radiative fluxes: </h3>
**Solar Radiation (Shortwave):** Most energy input comes from the sun; absorbed by the ocean surface.
**Longwave Radiation:** Ocean emits longwave radiation (IR) back to the atmosphere.

<h3> Turbulent fluxes: </h3>
**Latent Heat Flux:** Energy loss due to evaporation; carries moisture to the atmosphere.
**Sensible Heat Flux:** Direct heat exchange between ocean and air due to temperature difference.

**Net Heat Flux** = (Incoming Solar) - (Outgoing Longwave + Latent + Sensible)
