<h1> Air-Sea Interactions Theory </h1>

**Why should we care about air-sea interactions?**

We have come to learn that the Earth's energy distribution is fundamentally influenced by the ocean motion and the exchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere. The ocean stores and transports vast amounts of heat, and air-sea fluxes (like latent heat, sensible heat, and radiative fluxes) govern how energy is exchanged between the ocean and atmosphere. This exchange is central to weather patterns, climate systems, and the global energy balance.

Furthermore, air-sea exchanges play a critical role in prediction across a wide range of timescales — from daily weather to long-term climate. These exchanges influence key phenomena such as floods, droughts, storm intensity, and storm tracks. As a result, protecting people, property, and natural resources from extreme weather events and the impacts of climate variability and change depends on our ability to produce accurate and useful forecasts. This includes predictions beyond the traditional 1–10-day range, extending to sub-seasonal, seasonal, and even decadal timescales. Achieving this requires a strong understanding of the physical processes governing air-sea interactions and the factors that drive their variability.

<h2> What are the key components involved? </h2>

- **Atmosphere:** The lower part (troposphere) is most relevant for interactions. The part of direct relevance for air-sea interactions is the marine atmospheric boundary layer, often abbreviated to MABL.
- **Ocean mixed layer:** The uppermost layer (~10–100 m), also known as the mixed layer or ocean boundary layer, is directly influenced by atmospheric forcing across the air-sea interface.

<h2> Energy Exchange Processes </h2>

<h3> Radiative fluxes: </h3>

- **Solar Radiation (Shortwave):** Most energy input comes from the sun; absorbed by the ocean surface. 
- **Longwave Radiation:** Ocean emits longwave radiation (IR) back to the atmosphere.

<h3> Turbulent fluxes: </h3>

- **Latent Heat Flux:** Energy loss due to evaporation; carries moisture to the atmosphere.
- **Sensible Heat Flux:** Direct heat exchange between ocean and air due to temperature difference.

**Net Heat Flux** = (Incoming Solar) - (Outgoing Longwave + Latent + Sensible)

<h3> Mass exchange: </h3>

- **Evaporation:** Transfers water from the ocean to the atmosphere.
- **Precipitation:** Returns water from the atmosphere to the ocean.
- **Gas Exchange:** Exchange of gases like O₂, CO₂ based on concentration gradients.
