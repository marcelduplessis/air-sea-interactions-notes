<h1> Basics of Air-Sea Interactions Theory </h1>

Air-sea interaction refers to the exchange of energy, momentum, and mass between the atmosphere and the ocean.

These interactions play a central role in weather, climate regulation, and ocean circulation.

<h2> Key Components Involved </h2>

**Atmosphere:** The lower part (troposphere) is most relevant for interactions.

**Ocean Surface Layer:** The uppermost layer (~10â€“100 m), also known as the mixed layer, is directly influenced by atmospheric forcing.
